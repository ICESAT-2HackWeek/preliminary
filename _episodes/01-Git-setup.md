### Overview

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a popular version control system that is the foundation of most open source software development. You are not required to know Git in advance of this event, but come prepared to learn a lot about it!

### Getting an account

The most important thing you can before coming to our hackweek is to sign up for a GitHub account if you don't already have one. Just navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/):
