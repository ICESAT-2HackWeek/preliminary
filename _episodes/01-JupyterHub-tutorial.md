### What is JupyterHub? 

JupyterHub is a way to give a Jupyter Notebook server to each person in a group. [These slides](https://www.slideshare.net/willingc/jupyterhub-a-thing-explainer-overview?from_action=save) give a nice overview. We use JupyterHub in an educational setting because it enables us to quickly begin working with code without spending time to get the necessary libraries and dependencies set up on everyone's individual computers.

### Connecting to JupyterHub

Prior to the event we invited everyone to get set up with a GitHub account if they didn't already have one. We need this of course for our Git/GitHub tutorials, but this is also a mechanism for you to access our JupyterHub resources. 

Click [here](https://icesat2.pangeo.io) to access the incstance of JupyterHub we created for this event. The first time you connect to this you will be asked to provide your Github credentials. After entering your credentials the server will start, which can take anywhere from a few seconds to five minutes. Please be patient when the server is loading.
